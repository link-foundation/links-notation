# Solution Summary for Issue #135

## Problem Statement

The parser was treating documents with leading spaces differently than documents without leading spaces, even when the relative indentation was the same.

### Example of the Bug:
These two should parse identically, but didn't:

```yaml
  TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: 'value'
  TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHATS:
    item1
    item2
```

```yaml
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: 'value'
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHATS:
  item1
  item2
```

In the first example, the parser incorrectly treated `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHATS` as a child of `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` because both had 2 spaces, and the second line appeared to have the same indentation as the first.

## Root Cause

All parsers were counting **absolute** indentation (number of spaces from the start of the line) instead of **relative** indentation (increase/decrease compared to the parent level).

## Solution

The fix normalizes indentation by:
1. Detecting the first content line's indentation and treating it as the baseline (level 0)
2. Subtracting this baseline from all subsequent lines
3. This makes the indentation **relative** to the first content line

### Implementation Details

#### Rust (`rust/src/parser.rs`)
- Added `base_indentation` field to `ParserState`
- Added `set_base_indentation()`, `get_base_indentation()`, and `normalize_indentation()` methods
- Modified `first_line()` to capture and set the base indentation
- Updated `push_indentation()` and `check_indentation()` to normalize values before comparison

#### JavaScript (`js/src/grammar.pegjs`)
- Added `baseIndentation` variable to track the first line's indentation
- Added `setBaseIndentation()` and `normalizeIndentation()` functions
- Updated `document` rule to skip only empty lines (not leading spaces on content lines)
- Added `SET_BASE_INDENTATION` rule called from `firstLine`
- Modified `PUSH_INDENTATION` and `CHECK_INDENTATION` to use normalized values

#### C# (`csharp/Link.Foundation.Links.Notation/Parser.peg`)
- Added `BaseIndentation` to parser state
- Added `skipEmptyLines` rule to preserve leading spaces on first content line
- Added `SET_BASE_INDENTATION` rule
- Updated `PUSH_INDENTATION` and `CHECK_INDENTATION` to normalize indentation

#### Python (TODO)
- Needs similar changes to `python/links_notation/parser.py`
- Should track `base_indentation` in the Parser class
- Update `_parse_element()` to normalize indentation values

## Test Coverage

Added comprehensive test cases for all languages:
- `rust/tests/indentation_consistency_tests.rs`
- `js/tests/IndentationConsistency.test.js`
- `csharp/Link.Foundation.Links.Notation.Tests/IndentationConsistencyTests.cs`

Each test suite verifies:
1. Documents with leading spaces vs no leading spaces produce identical results
2. Different indentation sizes (2 vs 4 spaces) work correctly
3. Multi-level nesting preserves structure regardless of indentation style

## Results
