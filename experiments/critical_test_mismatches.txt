CRITICAL TEST NAME MISMATCHES TO FIX
=====================================

Based on the TEST_CASE_COMPARISON.md, here are the critical mismatches where
tests clearly test the same thing but have different names:

1. Indented ID Syntax Category
   - JavaScript has extra spaces: "indented  i d" vs Python/Rust/C#: "indented id"
   - This appears to be a bug in JavaScript test naming (double spaces)
   
2. Nested Parser Category  
   - "indentation (parser)" (JS) vs "indentation parser" (C#) vs "indentation" (Python/Rust)
   - "nested indentation" vs "nested indentation (parser)" vs "nested indentation parser"
   
3. API Category
   - Test names are well aligned already!

4. Mixed Indentation Modes
   - JavaScript has "issue #105" in test names, others don't
   - "sequence/list context" (JS) vs "sequence context" (others)
   - "set/object context" (JS) vs "set context" (others)

5. Link Category
   - "link to string" vs "link tostring" (just casing/spacing)
   - "link escape reference for simple reference" vs "link escape reference simple"

6. Multiline Parser  
   - "parse and stringify 2" vs "parse and stringify test2" vs "parse and stringify test 2"
   - Just need consistent naming for this one test

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Fix JavaScript test names with double spaces in "indented  i d"
- Standardize "indentation (parser)" → "indentation parser" (remove parentheses)
- Standardize "parse and stringify test 2" variations to single name
- Consider renaming "issue #105" tests to remove issue numbers from names

Most of these are in JavaScript tests. Let's prioritize fixing the most obvious issues.
